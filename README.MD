# ACNH API

### Introduction:

ACNH API is a **free RESTful API** for **critters**, **fossils**, **art**, **music** and **villagers** from Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

This started for me as a little side project for me but ended up getting much attraction than I ever thought it would get (~100 000 requests per day). I'll be working on making the API documentation and website better in the coming days.

If any of the information on the website is wrong or outdated, you can either contact me on Discord (Alexis#8717) or make a pull request on this repository.

Buy me a [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/acnhapi) and help contribute toward the server costs to keep this service free!

### Usage:

All the JSON data from this API is under MIT license, the images and music assets are the sole property of Nintendo.

The documentation for the API can be found [here](https://acnhapi.com/doc).

No authentification is required to make requests to any of the endpoints which can be accessed over HTTP or HTTPS.
